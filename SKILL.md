# Design Effects Skill

## Purpose
This skill teaches an agent to make strong, deliberate design-effect decisions — from choosing a morphism style to selecting the right animation primitive to knowing when restraint is the better design move. For any visual output requiring motion, depth, texture, or atmosphere, the agent should:

1. Identify the context, brand tier, and performance budget.
2. Check the Page-Type Recipes section first — if the project matches a known archetype, use that stack directly.
3. Use the Decision Guide to fill in any gaps or custom needs.
4. Pick the lightest effect that achieves the visual goal.
5. Apply the minimal code snippet as a starting point.
6. Cross-reference [color-combo-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/color-combo-skill) for palette pairing.
7. Check accessibility, dark mode, and reduced-motion behavior before shipping.
8. For components not covered here, browse [React Bits](https://www.reactbits.dev/get-started/index) — an open source collection of animated, interactive, and fully customizable React components. Install only the specific component you need. Credit the source when adapting their work.

## Core Rules
- **Never add effects for the sake of effects.** Every animation or visual style must serve atmosphere, feedback, hierarchy, or focus.
- **Performance first.** Heavy effects (3D, shaders, particles, distortion, liquid glass) belong on hero moments, not across the whole interface.
- **One hero effect per page.** If a page has a ShaderGradient hero, it does not also need Ballpit, neon borders, and liquid glass cards.
- **Mobile check.** Shader, 3D, and cursor-dependent effects often fail on mobile. Always provide a static or touch-friendly fallback.
- **Morphism needs a background.** Glass, clay, and neuo effects only work when the background provides contrast and context.
- **Neumorphism and accessibility are enemies.** Use only after a deliberate contrast audit, and usually only for decorative surfaces.
- **Dark mode changes the material system.** Shadows weaken, glows strengthen, borders need lower contrast, and glass opacity must change.
- **Color bridge.** Always source colors from [color-combo-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/color-combo-skill) instead of arbitrary hex choices.

## Page-Type Recipes

Each recipe is a complete, opinionated effect stack for a specific project archetype. Use these directly — don't mix stacks between archetypes.

> **Agent rule:** When a project clearly matches one of these archetypes, apply this recipe as the starting point. Only deviate when the brief explicitly calls for it.

> **React Bits:** This skill covers the most decision-critical components. For the full catalog of animated, interactive, and customizable React components — including variants not listed here — browse [React Bits](https://www.reactbits.dev/get-started/index). Install only the specific component you need via their CLI or manual copy method. Always credit the source when adapting their work.

| Hero text | BlurText or SplitText | One animated headline, everything else static |
| Card surface | Glassmorphism (standard or brand-tinted) | On a dark base — glass only works on rich background |
| Feature section | Bento Grid (2×2 hero card + smaller supporting) | SpotlightCard for hover interaction on each cell |
| Scroll reveals | IntersectionObserver + stagger (80ms offset) | Fade + translateY(20px) |
| Social proof | Infinite scroll marquee (logos) + CountUp (stats) | Marquee pauses on hover |
| Accent | Gradient border on primary CTA | Pseudo-element technique, animated spin optional |
| Typography | GradientText on subheadline label | Keep to one element — badge or eyebrow label |
| Page transition | Framer Motion fade + y:8 | 200ms ease-out |
| Mobile fallback | Static gradient background | Disable ShaderGradient on `max-width: 768px` |

**Palette:** Otherworldly, Dreamy Periwinkle, or Silver Pulse from color-combo-skill.

| Card surface | Dark glass + animated neon glow border | `border: 1px solid accent` + glow-pulse keyframe |
| Feature section | Scroll-snap horizontal gallery | Full-bleed cards, one per feature |
| Scroll reveals | Stagger entrance (60ms, faster than SaaS) | Faster tempo matches brand energy |
| CTA button | Spinning gradient border + colored shadow | Accent: Midnight Frag cyan or Neon Abyss green |
| Accent typography | Outlined stroke text as section background texture | Low opacity, oversized, pointer-events none |
| Loader | Custom animated SVG progress bar | On-brand color, no default spinner |
| Motion speed | Sharp easing (100–160ms), high stiffness spring | Snappy not smooth — gaming prefers crisp |
| Mobile fallback | Particles → static dark gradient with grain | Disable Hyperspeed on mobile unconditionally |

| Hero text | FadeContent or BlurText (slow, 200ms delay) | Never GlitchText or rapid SplitText |
| Card surface | Soft glassmorphism on light background | High blur, very low opacity — barely-there glass |
| Feature section | Stagger reveal grid (gentle, 120ms offset) | No Bento — keep layout calm and predictable |
| Scroll reveals | FadeContent only — no translate, no scale | Motion must be invisible as a technique |
| Social proof | Static testimonial cards with mask-reveal on scroll | No marquee — scrolling content feels rushed |
| CTA button | Full states (hover lift, active press) | No glow, no spinning border — clean and trusted |
| Empty states | Lottie illustration (calm loop) | Never use a spinner alone in an empty state |
| Icon animation | SVG stroke draw on success confirmations | Checkmark draw, circle draw — reassuring feedback |
| Motion timing | Ease-out, 250–400ms, never under 180ms | Slow timing = calm = trusted |

**Palette:** Nature / Organic (Eucalyptus Glow), Healthcare (Clinical Clarity, Vital Green), or Soft Gradients from color-combo-skill.

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hero background | DotGrid (animated, subtle) or ShaderGradient (monochrome) | Low energy background — the code content is the hero |
| Hero text | SplitText or plain — never over-animated | Developers respect restraint; distrust heavy effects |
| Card surface | Brutalism accents OR flat dark surface with gradient border | Not both — pick one material language |
| Feature section | Bento Grid or plain responsive grid | SpotlightCard acceptable on dark UI feature cells |
| Scroll reveals | IntersectionObserver, translateY only, 0.3s | Fast and clean — not dramatic |
| Code blocks | Syntax-highlighted, ShinyText for copy-to-clipboard badge | No animation on the code itself |
| CTA button | Brutalist offset shadow OR subtle glow — not both | Match the card language chosen above |
| Terminal/CLI moment | Animated SVG stroke for typing cursor effect | Draws developer attention immediately |
| Social proof | CountUp for GitHub stars, npm downloads, users | Hard numbers land better than testimonials |
| Motion timing | Sharp easing (120–200ms) | Tool-like tempo |

**Palette:** Acid Contemporary, Minimalist (Bone & Carbon), or Corporate (Steel Authority) from color-combo-skill.
**Font stack:** Space Grotesk + Geist + JetBrains Mono — see [font-pairing-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill).

---

### Recipe 5 — Creative Portfolio / Agency

**Mood:** High-personality, experimental, one-of-a-kind.

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hero background | ShaderGradient or full-bleed editorial photography | If photography: grain overlay + blend mode for texture |
| Cursor | Custom cursor dot with `mix-blend-mode: difference` | Only on desktop — hide on touch devices |
| Hero text | Variable font weight animation on hover OR SplitText | One technique only — not both |
| Card surface | Image zoom + overlay — no morphism | Let the work speak; morphism competes with the content |
| Project grid | Masonry or asymmetric CSS grid | CircularGallery or Scroll-snap horizontal gallery |
| Scroll reveals | Mask reveal (clip-path wipe) on each project image | Left-to-right or bottom-to-top wipe |
| Page transitions | Framer Motion — full cover wipe or opacity crossfade | Adds brand identity at the route level |
| Typography | Outlined stroke text as section label or background texture | One instance — not every section |
| Accent | liquid-logo on logo reveal OR gradient border on CTA | One statement liquid/glass moment total |
| Motion timing | Premium ease cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1), 400–600ms | Slower and more deliberate = premium craft |

**Palette:** Any — but pick one and commit. Luxury, Gothic / Dark Romance, and Acid Contemporary all work at this tier.
**Font stack:** Clash Display + Manrope — see [font-pairing-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill).
**Icon stack:** Minimal or custom only — see [icon-system-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/icon-system-skill).

**Never use in this archetype:** Skeleton loaders, enterprise grids, standard button libraries, default browser cursors on desktop.

---

### Recipe 6 — Consumer Lifestyle App

**Mood:** Warm, energetic, tactile, approachable.

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hero background | Aurora (warm tones) or static gradient with grain | Ballpit acceptable for playful onboarding moment only |
| Hero text | BlurText or RotatingText (max 4 words) | Friendly and readable, not aggressive |
| Card surface | Claymorphism (light background only) | Inflated, colorful, tactile — matches lifestyle brand |
| Feature section | Stagger grid with clay cards | 100ms offset, translateY(12px) |
| Scroll reveals | FadeContent or ScrollReveal | Gentle, not dramatic |
| Social proof | CountUp + Marquee testimonials | Warm social proof — reviews, not metrics |
| CTA button | Clay button style with press state | Inner highlight + offset shadow for clay feel |
| Onboarding | Lottie illustrations for each step | Playful, branded, non-generic |
| Icon animation | Bouncy SVG icons (spring physics, scale 0.9→1.1→1) | Matches the playful material language |
| Motion timing | Spring (medium stiffness, medium damping) + ease-out | Approachable and bouncy, not corporate |

**Palette:** Warm Tropical / Resort, Soft Gradients (Peach Champagne, Dreamy Periwinkle), or Luxury Facade from color-combo-skill.
**Font stack:** Cabinet Grotesk + Nunito — see [font-pairing-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill).

---

### Recipe 7 — Dark Editorial / Magazine

**Mood:** Cinematic, high contrast, still, atmospheric.

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hero background | Full-bleed photography + grain overlay + dark scrim | No animated background — image IS the hero |
| Grain | Grain overlay at 6–10% opacity, `mix-blend-mode: overlay` | Applied to every section, not just hero |
| Hero text | Oversized display type — possibly outlined/stroke | Static or slow fade-in — never spring or glitch |
| Card surface | Glassmorphism (dark tinted) on editorial image cards | Image zoom on hover underneath glass |
| Section dividers | Mask-reveal wipe as content transitions in | Horizontal wipe, 0.8s ease-out |
| Typography detail | Variable font hover on article titles | Subtle weight shift on hover — 300 → 700 |
| Accent | Gradient border (muted, low saturation) on featured item | One per page |
| Body motion | FadeContent only | Never animate body copy |
| Social / sharing | ShinyText on "New" or "Featured" badge | Minimal — one accent per page |

**Never use in this archetype:** Claymorphism, Ballpit, Particles, CountUp, Hyperspeed, Marquee.

---

### Recipe 8 — Enterprise Dashboard / B2B SaaS

**Mood:** Trusted, efficient, precise, data-forward.

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Background | Flat dark or flat light — no animated background in app shell | DotGrid acceptable on marketing/login page only |
| Hero / onboarding | FadeContent or ScrollReveal on first login | Welcome state only — never in everyday dashboard |
| Card surface | Flat with elevation shadow system (Level 1–2 only) | No morphism in data-heavy contexts |
| Data visualization | Stagger entrance on charts (bars animate in sequentially) | CountUp on KPI metrics |
| Loading states | Shimmer skeleton (matches card layout exactly) | Never use a full-page spinner in a dashboard |
| Interactions | Full button states — hover, active, focus-visible, disabled | Non-negotiable; must pass WCAG |
| Modals / drawers | Drawer slide-in (translateX), modal fade+scale(0.98→1) | 220–280ms, ease-out |
| Notification feed | AnimatedList (spring stagger) | Makes real-time updates feel live without noise |
| Tooltips | Fade + translateY(4px), 160ms | Fast — never block workflow |
| Motion timing | Soft ease-out (200–280ms) — purposeful but invisible | Motion should never be the thing users notice |

**Palette:** Corporate / Enterprise (Steel Authority, Slate Command), Minimalist, or Soft Gradients (light mode) from color-combo-skill.
**Font stack:** Inter + IBM Plex Mono — see [font-pairing-skill](https://github.com/bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill).

---

## Design Morphisms

Morphism styles define the material language of surfaces and cards. Choose one per project and apply it consistently.

> **Agent rule:** Never mix morphism styles in the same interface. Glass next to neumorphic controls next to brutalist cards is design indecision, not richness.

### Glassmorphism
- **What it is:** Frosted translucent surface using `backdrop-filter` blur, usually paired with subtle border and soft shadow.
- **Best for:** Premium overlays, nav bars on hero images, modal shells, dashboard highlights.
- **Avoid when:** The background is flat, the UI is dense, or readability is more important than atmosphere.

```css
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.glass-card--dark {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35);
  backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(160%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(160%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

### Neumorphism
- **What it is:** Soft raised or inset surfaces created with paired light and dark shadows on a same-color background.
- **Best for:** Decorative wellness surfaces, audio players, tactile widgets.
- **Avoid when:** Controls need strong clarity, contrast, or enterprise credibility.

```css
.neuo-raised {
  background: #E8E0D8;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow:
    8px 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    -8px -8px 16px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
}
```

### Claymorphism
- **What it is:** Inflated rounded surfaces with chunky shadows, inner highlights, and toy-like tactility.
- **Best for:** Playful mobile onboarding, consumer apps, lifestyle brands.
- **Avoid when:** Professional trust is the main goal.

```css
.clay-card {
  background: #FFD3B6;
  border-radius: 28px;
  box-shadow:
    0 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    0 16px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12),
    inset 0 -4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08),
    inset 0 4px 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
}
```

### Brutalism
- **What it is:** Flat color, hard borders, offset shadows, intentional roughness, no softness.
- **Best for:** Developer tools, editorial, creative agencies, anti-corporate brands.
- **Avoid when:** Safety, polish, and reassurance matter more than personality.

```css
.brutal-card {
  background: #F5E800;
  border: 3px solid #0A0A0A;
  border-radius: 0;
  box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px #0A0A0A;
  padding: 24px;
}
```

---

## Micro-interactions

Micro-interactions communicate response, affordance, and confidence. They are the difference between a UI feeling static versus alive.

> **Agent rule:** Every interactive element needs hover, active, focus-visible, and disabled or inactive behavior.

### Button States
```css
.button {
  background: #2A7AE8;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  font-weight: 600;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background 0.15s ease, transform 0.1s ease, box-shadow 0.15s ease;
}
.button:hover {
  background: #4A90F0;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(42, 122, 232, 0.35);
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
.button:active {
  background: #1A5AB8;
  transform: translateY(1px);
  box-shadow: none;
}
.button:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #2A7AE8;
  outline-offset: 3px;
}
.button:disabled {
  background: #A8B8CC;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

### Loading States
| Use | When |
|---|---|
| Skeleton | Layout shape is known |
| Spinner | Short inline action or unknown wait |
| Progress bar | Completion percentage is known |
| Shimmer skeleton | Preferred when keeping layout stable |

### Success / Error State Animation
```css
@keyframes success-pulse {
  0% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(26, 138, 64, 0.4); }
  70% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 10px rgba(26, 138, 64, 0); }
  100% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(26, 138, 64, 0); }
}
.state-success { animation: success-pulse 0.6s ease-out; }

@keyframes error-shake {
  0%,100% { transform: translateX(0); }
  20% { transform: translateX(-6px); }
  40% { transform: translateX(6px); }
  60% { transform: translateX(-4px); }
  80% { transform: translateX(4px); }
}
.state-error { animation: error-shake 0.4s ease-out; }
```

### Hover Reveal Patterns
```css
.link-underline { position: relative; text-decoration: none; }
.link-underline::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0; bottom: -2px;
  width: 0; height: 2px;
  background: currentColor;
  transition: width 0.25s ease;
}
.link-underline:hover::after { width: 100%; }
```

---

## Typography Effects

Typography can act as content, structure, and visual atmosphere simultaneously.

### Variable Font Animations
```css
.variable-headline {
  font-family: 'Inter Variable', sans-serif;
  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 300;
  transition: font-variation-settings 0.3s ease;
}
.variable-headline:hover { font-variation-settings: 'wght' 800; }
```

### Outlined / Stroke Text
```css
.text-outline {
  -webkit-text-stroke: 2px #0A0A0A;
  color: transparent;
  font-size: clamp(4rem, 10vw, 10rem);
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

### Oversized Display Texture
```css
.display-texture {
  position: absolute;
  font-size: clamp(8rem, 20vw, 20rem);
  font-weight: 900;
  opacity: 0.04;
  pointer-events: none;
  user-select: none;
}
```

### Gradient Text Fill
```css
.gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #B8C0FF, #E7D8FF, #D6C6F7, #B8C0FF);
  background-size: 200% auto;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  animation: gradient-flow 3s linear infinite;
}
@keyframes gradient-flow {
  0% { background-position: 0% center; }
  100% { background-position: 200% center; }
}
```

---

## Icon & SVG Animation

Animated icons are one of the most common product-level motion needs. They are small, expressive, and often lighter than full libraries.

> **Agent rule:** Use icon animation for state change and delight, not constant decoration. Repeating icon loops become visual noise fast.

### SVG Stroke Drawing
```css
.path-draw {
  stroke-dasharray: 400;
  stroke-dashoffset: 400;
  animation: draw 1.2s ease forwards;
}

@keyframes draw {
  to { stroke-dashoffset: 0; }
}
```

### Lottie
- **What it is:** JSON-based vector animation exported from After Effects, rendered with a lightweight player.
- **Best for:** Product onboarding, empty states, success states, branded explainer moments.
- **Avoid when:** A simple SVG or CSS animation would do.

```tsx
import Lottie from 'lottie-react'
import successAnimation from './success.json'

<Lottie animationData={successAnimation} loop={false} />
```

---

## Cursor Effects

Cursor design is a high-personality layer — powerful in portfolios and brand experiences, usually wrong for product UI.

> **Agent rule:** Cursor effects are desktop-only enhancements. Never rely on them for meaning, affordance, or navigation.

### Custom Cursor Dot
```css
.custom-cursor {
  position: fixed;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #D4AF37;
  pointer-events: none;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const move = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    if (cursorRef.current) {
      cursorRef.current.style.left = `${e.clientX}px`
      cursorRef.current.style.top = `${e.clientY}px`
    }
  }
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', move)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', move)
}, [])
```

---

## Image & Media Effects

### Mask Reveal on Scroll
```css
.image-reveal {
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
  animation: reveal 0.8s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes reveal {
  to { clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0); }
}
```

### Image Zoom + Overlay
```css

## Easing & Spring Reference

| Feel | Use | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Ease-out** | Most UI entrances, hover lifts, content reveal | 180–300ms |
| **Ease-in-out** | Balanced loops, panels | 250–400ms |
| **Linear** | Marquee, progress bars, loops | continuous |
| **Spring** | Cards, toggles, playful elements | tuned by stiffness/damping |
| **Sharp / snap** | Brutalist interactions, tool UIs | 100–180ms |

```css
--ease-premium: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
--ease-soft:    cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1);
--ease-snap:    cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
```

## Motion & Scroll

### IntersectionObserver Reveal
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) entry.target.classList.add('in-view')
    })
  }, { threshold: 0.2 })

  document.querySelectorAll('.reveal').forEach((el) => observer.observe(el))
  return () => observer.disconnect()
}, [])
```

```css
.reveal {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
  transition: opacity 0.5s var(--ease-premium), transform 0.5s var(--ease-premium);
}
.reveal.in-view { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
```

### CSS Scroll-Driven Animations
```css
@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
  .scroll-progress {
    animation: grow linear both;
    animation-timeline: scroll();
    animation-range: 0% 100%;
    transform-origin: left center;
  }
  @keyframes grow {
    from { transform: scaleX(0); }
    to { transform: scaleX(1); }
  }
}
```

### Page Transitions
```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion'

<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  <motion.div
    key={location.pathname}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 8 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -8 }}

## UI Motion Patterns

### Tooltip Entrance
```css
.tooltip {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(4px) scale(0.98);
  transition: opacity 0.16s var(--ease-soft), transform 0.16s var(--ease-soft);
}
.tooltip[data-open="true"] {
  opacity: 1;

  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

### Drawer / Sheet

.drawer {
  transform: translateX(100%);
  transition: transform 0.28s var(--ease-premium);
}
.drawer[data-open="true"] {
  transform: translateX(0);
}
```

---

## Layout Patterns

### Bento Grid
```css
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 16px;
}
.bento-1x1 { grid-column: span 1; }
.bento-2x1 { grid-column: span 2; }
.bento-1x2 { grid-column: span 1; }
.bento-2x2 { grid-column: span 2; }
```

### Scroll Snap Gallery
```css
.snap-x {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}
.snap-item {
  flex: 0 0 100%;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

### Infinite Scroll / Marquee
```css
.marquee-track {
  display: flex;
  width: max-content;
  animation: marquee 20s linear infinite;
}
@keyframes marquee {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}
```

## Dark Mode Adaptations

- Shadows weaken in dark mode; use glow or subtle borders instead.
- Glass opacity should increase slightly for readability.
- Gradient borders need lower saturation in dark contexts.
- Grain texture works at lower opacity in dark mode.
- Always add a dark scrim on text over animated backgrounds.

```css
.dark .glass-card {
  background: rgba(10, 12, 16, 0.45);
  border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
}
.dark .card-shadow {
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
}
```

---

## 3D in UI

### react-three-fiber
```tsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, MeshDistortMaterial } from '@react-three/drei'

export function Hero3D() {
  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 4] }}>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} />
      <mesh>
        <sphereGeometry args={[1.5, 64, 64]} />
        <MeshDistortMaterial color="#4B2E83" distort={0.4} speed={1.5} roughness={0.2} />
      </mesh>
      <OrbitControls enableZoom={false} autoRotate />
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

## Performance Tiers

| Tier | Effects | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Lightweight** | CSS transitions, simple keyframes, hover states, tooltip/dropdown motion, stroke SVG animation, DotGrid | Any project |
| **Medium** | Aurora, BlurText, SplitText, ShaderGradient, IntersectionObserver reveals, Bento, scroll snap | Modern products with controlled bundle size |
| **Heavy** | Ballpit, Hyperspeed, Particles, Lottie, liquid-glass-js, custom cursors, variable font motion | Landing pages, creative work, launches |
| **Maximum** | react-three-fiber, liquid-logo with complex SVG, stacked hero effects | Hero-only, code-split, fallback mandatory |

---

## Accessibility Rules

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for all animated systems.
- Do not rely on cursor effects for meaning.
- Neumorphism requires a contrast audit.
- Animated text must remain readable at every frame.
- Every interactive element needs visible `:focus-visible` states.
- Tooltip, dropdown, and drawer motion must not delay usability.

```tsx
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches
```

## CSS Quick Start

Copy-paste CSS custom properties and implementation checklists for each major effect style. Use these as the starting point — tweak values to match your palette.

### Glassmorphism

```css
/* Required: place over a vivid blurred background (blobs, gradients) */
--blur-amount: 15px;
--glass-opacity: 0.15;
--border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);

.glass-card {
  backdrop-filter: blur(var(--blur-amount)) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(var(--blur-amount)) saturate(180%);
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, var(--glass-opacity));
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
              inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ backdrop-filter blur 10–20px · ☐ Translucent bg 10–25% opacity · ☐ 1px light border · ☐ Vivid background behind card · ☐ Text contrast 4.5:1 verified · ☐ `-webkit-` prefix present · ☐ prefers-reduced-motion fallback

---

### Neumorphism

```css
--border-radius: 14px;
--shadow-light: -5px -5px 15px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
--shadow-dark:   5px  5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
--color-surface: #E0E5EC;

.neuo-card {
  background: var(--color-surface);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-light), var(--shadow-dark);
}
.neuo-card:active {
  box-shadow: inset var(--shadow-light), inset var(--shadow-dark);
  transition: box-shadow 150ms ease;
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ Rounded corners 12–16px · ☐ Dual shadow layers (light + dark) · ☐ Monochromatic pastel palette · ☐ Press animation 150ms · ☐ Contrast audit (neuo fails easily — test every text/background pair)

---

### Claymorphism

```css
--border-radius: 20px;
--border-width: 3px;
--shadow-inner: inset -2px -2px 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
--shadow-outer:       4px  4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
--color-clay: #FFB3C1; /* replace with your pastel */

.clay-card {
  background: var(--color-clay);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  border: var(--border-width) solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-inner), var(--shadow-outer);
}
/* Bounce animation */
@keyframes clay-bounce {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50%       { transform: scale(1.04); }
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ Border-radius 16–24px · ☐ Thick border 3–4px · ☐ Double shadows (inner + outer) · ☐ Pastel palette · ☐ Bounce animations cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) · ☐ Playful micro-interactions

---

### Brutalism

```css
--border-radius: 0px;
--border: 3px solid #000;
--font-weight: 800;
--transition: none;

.brutal-card {
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  border: var(--border);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight);
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 #000; /* offset shadow, no blur */
  transition: var(--transition);
}
.brutal-card:hover {
  transform: translate(-2px, -2px);
  box-shadow: 6px 6px 0 #000;
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ border-radius: 0 · ☐ Visible borders 2–4px · ☐ Bold/black typography 700+ · ☐ Pure primary colors (#FF0000 #0000FF #FFFF00) · ☐ No transitions or instant (0ms) · ☐ Asymmetric layout intentional

---

### Minimalism / Flat

```css
--spacing: 2rem;
--border-radius: 4px;
--shadow: none;
--accent: #0066CC; /* single accent only */

.flat-card {
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow);
  padding: var(--spacing);
  border: 1px solid #E5E7EB;
}
/* Hover: subtle background only, no lift */
.flat-card:hover { background: #F9FAFB; }
```

**Checklist:** ☐ No box-shadow or extremely subtle · ☐ 4–6 solid colors max · ☐ No gradients · ☐ Single accent color · ☐ Grid-based layout · ☐ Hover: background shift only (no translate)

---

### Dark OLED

```css
--bg-black: #000000;
--bg-surface: #0D0D0D;
--text-primary: #FFFFFF;
--text-secondary: #A0A0A0;
--accent-neon: #00F5FF; /* swap for your neon */
--glow: 0 0 12px rgba(0, 245, 255, 0.4);

body { background: var(--bg-black); color-scheme: dark; }
.oled-card {
  background: var(--bg-surface);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
  color: var(--text-primary);
}
.neon-accent { color: var(--accent-neon); text-shadow: var(--glow); }
```

**Checklist:** ☐ True black #000000 (OLED power save) · ☐ Text contrast 7:1+ · ☐ Neon accent used sparingly · ☐ No pure white backgrounds · ☐ color-scheme: dark declared · ☐ Glow effects minimal

---

### Aurora / Mesh Gradient

```css
@keyframes aurora {
  0%, 100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50%       { background-position: 100% 50%; }
}

.aurora-bg {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea, #764ba2, #f64f59, #c471ed);
  background-size: 300% 300%;
  animation: aurora 10s ease infinite;
  filter: saturate(1.2);
}
/* Text overlay needs dark scrim */
.aurora-text-overlay {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ Complementary color pairs · ☐ 8–12s animation loop · ☐ background-size 200–300% · ☐ Text always on scrim/overlay · ☐ prefers-reduced-motion: pause animation · ☐ Smooth color transitions

---

### Liquid Glass

```css
--morph-duration: 500ms;
--blur: 18px;

.liquid-glass {
  backdrop-filter: blur(var(--blur)) saturate(200%) brightness(1.1);
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  border-radius: 24px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
  /* Chromatic aberration via text-shadow on headings */
}
h2.chromatic {
  text-shadow: -1px 0 rgba(255, 0, 100, 0.5), 1px 0 rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.5);
}
@keyframes morph {
  0%, 100% { border-radius: 24px 16px 24px 16px; }
  50%       { border-radius: 16px 24px 16px 24px; }
}
```

**Checklist:** ☐ Morphing animations 400–600ms · ☐ Chromatic aberration on headings · ☐ Dynamic blur + saturate · ☐ Iridescent gradient background · ☐ One hero element only — not repeated across page · ☐ Mobile fallback (static blur)

---

### Motion-Driven / Scroll Reveal

```css
/* Use Intersection Observer — not CSS alone */
.reveal {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(24px);
  transition: opacity 350ms ease, transform 350ms ease;
  will-change: transform;
}
.reveal.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .reveal { opacity: 1; transform: none; transition: none; }
}
```

```js
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(e => { if (e.isIntersecting) e.target.classList.add('visible'); });
}, { threshold: 0.15 });
document.querySelectorAll('.reveal').forEach(el => observer.observe(el));
```

**Checklist:** ☐ Intersection Observer API · ☐ will-change: transform (not layout props) · ☐ Stagger children 30–50ms · ☐ prefers-reduced-motion respected · ☐ GPU-accelerated (transform/opacity only) · ☐ Entry animation ease-out, exit ease-in
